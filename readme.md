# AI Resume Shortlisting Project

This project uses machine learning to shortlist resumes based on the similarity to a job description. It uses natural language processing (NLP) and a logistic regression model to predict whether a resume is a good fit for the job.

## **Features**

- **Resume Processing:** Extracts text from .docx files (resumes) using Python libraries.
- **Job Description Analysis:** A sample job description is used to compare resumes.
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer:** Converts text data into numerical format for machine learning algorithms.
- **Logistic Regression:** Used to classify resumes based on job description similarity.
- **Visualization:** Displays shortlisted resumes based on model predictions and their probabilities.

## **Project Setup**

### Requirements
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or Google Colab.
2. Install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resume-shortlisting.git
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Project

1. Place the resumes (in .docx format) in the `resumes` folder.
2. Edit the job description in the script as needed.
3. Run the Python script to process and shortlist resumes based on the job description.
    python resume_shortlisting.py

4. The results will be displayed in a bar chart and printed in the console.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python** (for programming)
- **scikit-learn** (for machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression)
- **NLTK/TF-IDF** (for text preprocessing)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)
